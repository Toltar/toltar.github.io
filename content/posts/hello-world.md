## Introduction

My name is Matthew Dickens and welcome to my little blog. This will be the home where I will blog about all things programming/technology or anything really that interests me. My goal for this blog is to teach others what I have learned and to reach out to the community of fellow tech people to start meaningful discussions. I did start a blog back before back in college with a site a built in the [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) framework. But after discovering [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and how easy it is to start a blog from just markdown, I wanted to bring that spirit of sharing my knowledge/experiences with a vengeance. My other hope is by blogging about my thoughts and what I have learned I can be a better developer in all aspects.

## What kind of content should I expect from you?

This blog is strictly focused on technological related articles. Content such as tutorials, opinion pieces, and things I have learned. I believe in the mantra that order to truly master something, you have to be able to teach it. So that is what I plan to do here. 

I might stray from technology every once in awhile if I feel like it, this is my blog after all. But mainly its just technology and programming.

## Why should I read your stuff?

I am a programmer who has spent the last 12 years at the time of writing this learning how to program (and still am learning) with about 6 years of professional experience. I have been in the weeds with old and modern software development. From my time at NASA working as a contractor till now, I have gained a lot of experience. And I think it will be valuable to others to share my experiences with you. And yes, I have had to hot-fix something into production. Over that time that experience changed me and it still is. My hope is you learn from that experience or for you to teach me.
